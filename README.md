# IBM-1401

This project is some **early** inclomplete version of a IBM-1401 emulator written in vanilla Swift without any external libraries.

The whole emulator is quite incomplete. For now, not all opcodes are implemented and the emulator lacks of printer support or reading
external files into the storage.

More information about the machine itself: [http://ibm-1401.info](http://ibm-1401.info)

### Emulator commands

* l: Load program into storage
* d: dump storage
* r: execute
* q: quit
